## TokenGo CLI

> **Deprecated.** This oh-my-pi-based prototype is no longer maintained. TokenGo CLI development continues on the opencode-based fork: <https://github.com/zxcrf/opencode/tree/feat/tokengo>.

This worktree packages oh-my-pi as `tokengo` and adds the TokenGo provider.
User data is stored under `~/.tokengo`; run `tokengo login token-go` before
model discovery. The upstream oh-my-pi documentation follows.

## Install

**macOS · Linux**

```sh
curl -fsSL https://omp.sh/install | sh
```

> **Alpine / musl:** the prebuilt musl binary links `libstdc++`/`libgcc` dynamically, which stock Alpine does not ship. Install them first: `apk add libstdc++ libgcc`.

**Homebrew**

```sh
brew install can1357/tap/omp
```

**Bun (recommended)**

```sh
bun install -g @oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent
```

**Nix**

```sh
# Run without installing
nix run github:can1357/oh-my-pi

# Or install into the active profile
nix profile install github:can1357/oh-my-pi
```

Flake consumers can use `packages.<system>.omp`, `overlays.default`, `nixosModules.default`, or `homeManagerModules.default`. A Home Manager configuration can install OMP and own its settings declaratively:

```nix
{
  inputs.omp.url = "github:can1357/oh-my-pi";

  # In your Home Manager module:
  imports = [ inputs.omp.homeManagerModules.default ];
  programs.omp = {
    enable = true;
    settings.startup.quiet = true;
  };
}
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
irm https://omp.sh/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Pinned versions (mise)**

```sh
mise use -g github:can1357/oh-my-pi
```

macOS · Linux · Windows · bun ≥ 1.3.14

### Shell completions

`omp` generates its own completion scripts for **bash**, **zsh**, and **fish** from the live command/flag metadata, so they never drift from the actual CLI. Subcommands, flags, and enum values complete statically; model names (`--model`, `--smol`, `--slow`, `--plan`) resolve against the bundled model catalog and `--resume` against your on-disk sessions.

```sh
# zsh — add to ~/.zshrc (or write the output into a file on your $fpath)
eval "$(omp completions zsh)"

# bash — add to ~/.bashrc
eval "$(omp completions bash)"

# fish
omp completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/omp.fish
```

## Every tool, _benchmaxxed_.

Edits that land on the first attempt. Reads that summarize files instead of dumping their content. Searches that return instantly. Pick any model — omp will get it right.

| model            | metric       | what                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Grok Code Fast 1 | 6.7% → 68.3% | Tenfold lift the moment the edit format stops eating the model alive. |
| Gemini 3 Flash   | +5 pp        | Over str_replace — beats Google's own best attempt at the format.     |
| Grok 4 Fast      | −61% tokens  | Output collapses once the retry loop on bad diffs disappears.         |
| MiniMax          | 2.1×         | Pass rate more than doubles. Same weights, same prompt.               |

- `read` : summarized snippets · ideal defaults · selector hit rate
- `grep` : fastest in the west
- `lsp` : everything your IDE knows, the agent knows
- `prompts` : adjusted relentlessly for each model

## The Pi _you love_, with **batteries included**.

Originally built on [Mario Zechner](https://github.com/mariozechner)'s wonderful [Pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono), omp adds everything you're missing.

### 01 · Code execution w/ tool-calling

Most harnesses give the agent a Python sandbox and call it done. Ours runs persistent Python and a Bun worker, and either kernel can call back into the agent's own tools — read, search, task — over a loopback bridge. The agent loads a CSV with tool.read from inside Python, charts it from JavaScript, and never leaves the cell.

![omp TUI running Python code and rendering a chart.](assets/python.webp)

### 02 · LSP wired into every write

Ask for a rename and you get a rename. The call goes through workspace/willRenameFiles, so re-exports, barrel files, and aliased imports update before the file moves. Everything your IDE knows, the agent knows.

![omp TUI with TypeScript and Biome language servers active.](assets/lspv.webp)

_[Read the LSP config docs](docs/lsp-config.md)_

### 03 · Drives a real debugger

A C binary segfaults: the agent attaches lldb, steps to the bad pointer, reads the frame. A Go service hangs: it attaches dlv and walks the goroutines. A Python process is wedged: debugpy, pause, inspect, evaluate. Most agents are still sprinkling print statements.

![omp TUI: a live lldb-dap session against a native binary at /tmp/omp-native/demo. Adapter=lldb-dap, Status=stopped, Frame=xorshift32, Instruction pointer 0x10000055C, Location demo.c:6:10. Debug scopes and Debug variables cards show locals (x = 57351) and the agent confirms the math: x went from 7 → 57351 (= 7 ^ (7<<13)).](https://omp.sh/clips/dap-poster.webp)

_[Watch the capture ↗](https://omp.sh/clips/dap.mp4)_

### 04 · Time-traveling stream rules

Your rules sit dormant until the model goes off-script. A regex match aborts the stream mid-token, injects the rule as a system reminder, and retries from the same point. You get course-correction without paying context tax on every turn. Injections survive compaction, so the fix sticks.

![omp TUI: agent reading src.rs and about to write Box::leak when the request aborts (red `Error: Request was aborted`), an amber `⚠ Injecting rule: box-leak` card injects the rule body `Don't reach for Box::leak in production code paths`, and the agent then course-corrects by proposing `Arc<str>` and asking the user to confirm.](https://omp.sh/clips/ttsr-poster.webp)

_[Watch the capture ↗](https://omp.sh/clips/ttsr.mp4)_

### 05 · First-class subagents

Split a job across workers and get typed results back. task fans out into isolated worktrees, each worker runs its own tool surface, and the final yield is a schema-validated object the parent reads directly. No prose to parse, no merge conflicts between siblings, no orphaned edits.

![omp TUI showing `task` spawning two subagents `ComponentsExports` and `RoutesExports`, the constraints block requiring an IRC DM between peers, the per-subagent status cards with cost and duration, and a final Findings section listing both exports plus an honest 'IRC coordination note' about a one-sided handshake.](https://omp.sh/clips/irc-poster.webp)

_[Watch the capture ↗](https://omp.sh/clips/irc.mp4)_

Watch the fan-out while it runs: `Alt+A` opens [Agent Hub](docs/agent-hub.md), where the roster shows current activity and usage for every subagent. Open one to read its live transcript, type a steering message, revive a parked worker, or kill a stuck one without aborting the parent session.

### 06 · A second model, watching every turn.

Pair a reviewer model to the 'advisor' role and it reads every turn the main agent takes, injecting notes inline — a quiet aside, a concern, or a hard blocker. It runs on its own context and its own model, so it catches what the doer rushed past. The main agent sees the note and course-corrects, or tells you why it won't.

![omp TUI: /advisor status shows the advisor running on openai-codex/gpt-5.5; after the main agent scopes a catch to ENOENT instead of swallowing every error, an amber 'Advisor 1 note (concern)' card warns the fix no longer matches the user's literal acceptance criterion.](https://omp.sh/clips/advisor-poster.webp)

_[Watch the capture ↗](https://omp.sh/clips/advisor.mp4)_

### 07 · Hand someone the link, they're in.

/collab puts your live session on a relay and hands back a link — and a QR. A teammate joins from another terminal with omp join, or just opens it in a browser. Share read-write to pair on the same agent, or /collab view for a read-only link anyone can watch but no one can steer. Frames are sealed client-side; the relay never sees your keys.

![omp TUI: /collab view prints 'Collab session started!' with an omp join command, a my.omp.sh browser link, the note 'Anyone with this link can watch the session but cannot prompt the agent', and a large scannable QR code.](https://omp.sh/clips/collab-poster.webp)

_[Watch the capture ↗](https://omp.sh/clips/collab.mp4)_

### 08 · Read a pdf on arxiv, why not?

web_search chains twenty-three ranked providers and hands whatever URLs it finds straight to read. Arxiv PDFs, GitHub pages, Stack Overflow threads come back as structured markdown with anchors intact — the same tool surface you use on local files. Cite, follow, quote, never lose where you came from.

![omp TUI: web_search returns 10 ranked Perplexity sources for inference-time compute scaling, the agent picks an arxiv paper, calls read https://arxiv.org/pdf/2604.10739v1, and summarizes the paper's headline result with real numbers.](https://omp.sh/clips/web-poster.webp)

_[Watch the capture ↗](https://omp.sh/clips/web.mp4)_

### 09 · Unapologetically native. Even on Windows.

Other agents shell out to rg, grep, find, and bash. On many machines those binaries don't exist, and on the ones where they do, every call costs a fork-exec round-trip. omp links the real implementations into the process. ripgrep, glob, find: in-process. brush is the bash — with sessions that survive across calls, and 58 command-line utilities (ls, sed, sort, xargs, even jq) ported into the builtins crate and run in-process, zero fork/exec. The same omp binary runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows — no WSL bridge.

### 10 · Code review with priorities and a verdict

Get a clear verdict on whether the change ships, with every issue ranked P0 through P3 and scored for confidence. /review spawns dedicated reviewer subagents that sweep branches, single commits, or uncommitted work in parallel. You tackle what blocks release first; nothing important hides in a wall of prose.

Want to steer the review yourself? `/annotate code-review` opens the diff so you can pin notes to lines before the reviewers run. `/annotate` also takes the latest reply, a session message, a file, or quoted text and pastes your notes into the prompt. See [`/annotate`](docs/slash-command-internals.md#12-bundled-command-note-annotate).

### 11 · Hashline: edit by content hash

Perfect edits, fewer tokens. The model points at anchors instead of retyping the lines it wants to change, so whitespace battles and string-not-found loops just stop happening. Edit a stale file and the anchors diverge — we reject the patch before it corrupts anything. Grok 4 Fast spends 61% fewer output tokens on the same work.

### 12 · GitHub is just another filesystem

Other harnesses bolt on gh_issue_view, gh_pr_view, gh_search — each with its own parameters the agent has to learn and you have to debug. We skipped that. read already handles paths; PRs are paths. One interface to teach the model, one surface to keep correct.

### 13 · Memory the agent curates

The agent remembers your codebase between sessions. It writes facts mid-run with retain, captures reusable lessons with learn, pulls them back with recall, and compresses each session into a mental model that loads on the first turn of the next one. Pick the engine with `memory.backend` — local, Hindsight, or Mnemopi. Project-scoped by default, so what it learns about this repo stays with this repo.

### 14 · ACP: editor-drivable agent

Run omp inside Zed and you get the same agent you drive from the terminal — reading the buffer you're actually looking at, writing through the editor's save path, spawning shells in the editor's terminal. Destructive tools pause for a permission prompt you can answer once and forget. No bridge, no plugin, no second brain to keep in sync.

### 15 · Inherits what your other tools already wrote

Every other agent ships an importer and expects you to convert. omp reads the eight formats already on disk in their native shape — Cursor MDC, Cline .clinerules, Codex AGENTS.md, Copilot applyTo, and the rest. No migration script, no YAML-to-TOML port, no "supported subset" footnotes. The config your team wrote last quarter still works tonight.

### 16 · omp commit: atomic splits, validated messages

omp reads the working tree through git_overview, git_file_diff, and git_hunk, then splits unrelated changes into atomic commits ordered by their dependencies. Cycles are rejected before anything is written. Source files score above tests, docs, and configs, so the headline commit is the one that matters. Lock files are excluded from analysis entirely.

### 17 · Read PRs. _Walk skills._ Pull JSON out of subagents.

Sixteen internal schemes — `pr://`, `issue://`, `agent://`, `skill://`, `ssh://`, and the rest — resolve transparently inside every FS-shaped tool the agent already calls. `read pr://1428` returns the same shape as `read src/foo.ts`. `grep` walks a diff like a directory. `agent://<id>/findings.0.path` pulls a field out of a subagent's output by path.

### 18 · Conflict resolution, made easy.

Each merge conflict becomes one URL. The agent writes `@theirs`, `@ours`, or `@base` to `conflict://N` and the file resolves cleanly. Bulk form: `conflict://*`.

![omp TUI: ✓ Read src/session.ts (⚠ 1 conflict), then ✓ Write conflict://1 · 1 line with content @theirs, then a confirmation 'Resolved.'](https://omp.sh/clips/conflict-poster.webp)

_[Watch the capture ↗](https://omp.sh/clips/conflict.mp4)_

### 19 · Preview, then accept.

`ast_edit` returns a _(proposed)_ card with the replacement count. The change is staged. The agent writes a one-line reason to `xd://resolve`; the TUI turns it into an **Accept** card and the disk move happens — atomic, all or nothing.

![omp TUI: ✓ AST Edit: console.log($X) (proposed) 3 replacements · 1 file, then ✓ Accept: 3 replacements in 1 file (AST Edit), followed by 'Applied 3 replacements in src/auth.ts.'](https://omp.sh/clips/codemod-poster.webp)

_[Watch the capture ↗](https://omp.sh/clips/codemod.mp4)_

### 20 · Drives a _real browser_. _Or your Slack?_

Eval's `browser.open(...)` returns a tab handle with direct navigation, inspection, interaction, and element helpers; `tab.run(...)` handles custom JavaScript. It drives Chromium or Electron in an isolated tab runtime. Stealth is on by default, while the browser relay can adopt Chrome tabs you already have open without stealing focus.

### 21 · Hands on the desktop itself

Eval's `computer` helpers — `computer.window(...)`, `win.screenshot()`, `win.ax()`, `el.press()`, plus `computer.run(fnOrCode, options)` for multi-step scripts — control the real host: enumerate windows and displays, capture screenshots, send native input, walk the OS accessibility tree, and use the clipboard. It exposes no browser DOM.

## Whatever the task needs, _it's already in the box_.

Core tools live in the same namespace as `read` and `bash`. Pin the active set with `--tools read,edit,bash,…`; rarely used discoverable tools stay behind `xd://` devices. `read xd://` lists them, and `write xd://<tool>` runs one when `tools.xdev` is enabled.

**Files & search**

- `read` — files, dirs, archives, SQLite, PDFs, notebooks, URLs, remote `ssh://` paths, and internal `://` schemes through one path.
- `write` — create or overwrite a file, archive entry, or SQLite row.
- `edit` — hashline patches with content-hash anchors and stale-anchor recovery.
- `ast_edit` — structural rewrites previewed before apply, via ast-grep.
- `ast_grep` — structural code queries over 50+ tree-sitter grammars.
- `grep` — regex over files, globs, and internal URLs.
- `glob` — glob-based path lookup; reach for `grep` when you need content matches.

**Runtime**

- `bash` — workspace shell with 46 in-process coreutils, optional PTY, and background-job dispatch.
- `eval` — persistent Python and JavaScript cells with shared prelude and tool re-entry.

**Code intelligence**

- `lsp` — diagnostics, navigation, symbols, renames, code actions, raw requests.
- `debug` — drive a DAP session — breakpoints, stepping, threads, stack, variables.
- `security_scan` — plan and run native security reviews; drives Codex Security cloud scans.

**Coordination**

- `task` — fan out subagents in parallel, optionally workspace-isolated.
- `wait` — block until the next background result, peer message, or steering interrupt; message peers and control jobs via `agent://` and `proc://`.
- `todo` — ordered mutations over the session todo list with phase tracking.
- `ask` — structured follow-up questions for interactive runs.

**Desktop & web**

- `browser` — Puppeteer tabs over headless Chromium, CDP-attached apps, or your own Chrome via the relay.
- `computer` — persistent JS against the host desktop: windows, screenshots, native input, AX tree, clipboard.
- `web_search` — one query across configured providers, returning answer plus citations.
- `github` — GitHub CLI ops — repo, PR, issues, code search, Actions run-watch.
- `generate_image` — generate or edit raster images via Gemini, GPT, or xAI Grok image models.
- `tts` — text-to-speech via xAI Grok Voice — five built-in voices, WAV or MP3.

**Memory & skills**

- `checkpoint` — mark conversation state for a later collapse-and-report.
- `rewind` — prune exploratory context, keep a concise report.
- `retain` — queue durable facts into the active memory bank.
- `recall` — search the memory bank for raw memories.
- `reflect` — synthesize an answer over the bank.
- `memory_edit` — update, forget, or invalidate stored memories by id.
- `learn` — capture a reusable lesson; optionally promote it into a managed skill.
- `manage_skill` — create, update, or delete an isolated managed skill.

Setting-gated, off by default: `github`, `security_scan`, `generate_image`, `tts`, `checkpoint`, `rewind`, and the memory tools (`retain`/`recall`/`reflect`/`memory_edit`, per `memory.backend`).

### Prompt controls

Three standalone, lowercase words opt a turn into specialized agent behavior:

- `ultrathink` — request careful multi-step reasoning and the highest supported automatic thinking effort.
- `orchestrate` — run substantial independent work through parallel subagents and verify each phase.
- `workflowz` — build a deterministic multi-subagent workflow with the active `task` tool.

They trigger only in prose, not inside code spans, fenced code blocks, XML/HTML sections, identifiers, or paths. See [Magic keywords](docs/magic-keywords.md) for exact matching rules and configuration.

### Session controls

Slash commands shift how a whole session runs:

- `/vibe` — enter [Vibe mode](docs/vibe-mode.md): act as a director driving persistent `fast`/`good` worker sessions with a `read`-only toolset.
- `/fresh` — reset the provider stream state (stale prompt cache, wedged stream) without changing the local transcript. See [Session operations](docs/session-operations-export-share-fork-resume.md#fresh).

## Sixty-plus providers, a thousand models, _one /model away_.

Nine roles route work by intent. `default` for normal turns. `smol` for cheap subagent fan-out. `slow` for deep reasoning. `plan` for plan mode. `commit` for changelogs. Plus `vision`, `task`, `advisor`, and `tiny` for their namesakes. Override at launch with `--smol`, `--slow`, or `--plan`; cycle through the configured models for the active role with `Ctrl+P`. Swap the active model mid-session with the `/model` slash command.

Auth tags below: `oauth` signs in with your provider account, `plan` routes through a coding-plan subscription, `local` runs against a local server with the key optional.

### Frontier APIs

Direct APIs and gateways. Mix providers per role.

Anthropic `oauth` · OpenAI · OpenAI Codex `oauth` · Google Gemini · Google Vertex · Google Antigravity `oauth` · xAI · SuperGrok `oauth` · DeepSeek · Mistral · Groq · Cerebras · Fireworks · Together · Baseten · DeepInfra · Hugging Face · NVIDIA · Meta · Amazon Bedrock · Azure OpenAI · SiliconFlow · GMI Cloud · CoreWeave · Sakana AI · Command Code · Charm Hyper · StepFun · Helmcode · OpenRouter · Synthetic · Vercel AI Gateway · Cloudflare AI Gateway · Wafer Serverless

### Coding plans

Subscription-routed. `/login` attaches the session.

Cursor `oauth` · GitHub Copilot `oauth` · GitLab Duo · Devin `oauth` · Kimi Code `plan` · Moonshot · MiniMax Coding Plan `plan` · MiniMax Coding Plan CN `plan` · Alibaba Coding Plan `plan` · Qwen Portal `oauth` · Z.AI / GLM Coding Plan `plan` · Zhipu Coding Plan `plan` · Xiaomi MiMo · Qianfan · Umans `plan` · NanoGPT · Novita · Venice · Kilo · ZenMux · OpenCode Go · OpenCode Zen

### Run it yourself

OpenAI-compatible `/v1/models`. Local instances skip the key.

Ollama `local` · Ollama Cloud · LM Studio `local` · llama.cpp `local` · vLLM `local` · LiteLLM

### Custom OpenAI-compatible providers

Define custom providers in `~/.omp/agent/models.yml`:

```yaml
providers:
  spark:
    baseUrl: http://192.168.10.223:8000/v1
    api: openai-completions
    apiKey: dummy
    models:
      - id: minimax-m3
        name: MiniMax M3
        contextWindow: 100000
        maxTokens: 32000
```

Run `omp models spark` to verify discovery. Then run `omp setup` and choose the model in the default-model step, or open `/model` in a session and assign it to the `default` role.

To preconfigure the default without the picker, add the selector to `~/.omp/agent/config.yml`:

```yaml
modelRoles:
  default: spark/minimax-m3
```

### Four knobs that make routing useful

- **Custom providers** — Declare anything that speaks `openai-completions`, `openai-responses`, `openai-codex-responses`, `azure-openai-responses`, `anthropic-messages`, `bedrock-converse-stream`, `google-generative-ai`, `google-gemini-cli`, `google-vertex`, `typesafe`, or `openrouter-decisions` (the two judge APIs) in `~/.omp/agent/models.yml`.
- **Fallback chains** — Per-role or per-model chains under `retry.fallbackChains`. When the primary throws 429s or hits a quota wall, the next entry takes the rest of the turn — restored on cooldown.
- **Path-scoped models** — Scope `enabledModels` and `disabledProviders` entries to a `path:` prefix to pin a different model set on one repo without touching the global config. Scoped entries cover the path and everything under it.
- **Round-robin credentials** — Stack API keys per provider and the runtime rotates with session affinity and per-credential backoff. Useful when one key would burn its quota by lunch.

Full provider & routing reference at [omp.sh/docs/providers](https://omp.sh/docs/providers).

## Twenty-three backends. _One tool the agent already knows_.

`web_search` is built in, not bolted on. `auto` walks a twenty-three-provider chain; pin one by name if you already pay for it. Behind every hit, site-aware extraction turns GitHub, registries, arXiv, Stack Overflow, and docs into structured markdown — anchors and link targets survive.

### Search providers

Twenty-three backends. Pin one, or let `auto` walk the chain in order.

| provider     | auth                                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `auto`       | chain                                     |
| `perplexity` | `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` (anonymous fallback) |
| `gemini`     | oauth                                     |
| `anthropic`  | oauth                                     |
| `codex`      | oauth                                     |
| `xai`        | oauth or `XAI_API_KEY`                    |
| `zai`        | `ZAI_API_KEY`                             |
| `exa`        | `EXA_API_KEY` (or mcp)                    |
| `tinyfish`   | `TINYFISH_API_KEY`                        |
| `jina`       | `JINA_API_KEY`                            |
| `kagi`       | `KAGI_API_KEY`                            |
| `tavily`     | `TAVILY_API_KEY`                          |
| `firecrawl`  | `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` (keyless fallback)    |
| `brave`      | `BRAVE_API_KEY`                           |
| `kimi`       | `/login kimi-code` or search key          |

| `mojeek`     | no key (browser)                          |
| `public`     | no key (all of the above, consolidated)   |

Exa also accepts a stored API key through `/login exa`; explicit keyless selection uses the public MCP fallback.

### Specialised handlers

The agent gets structured content, not stripped HTML.

- **Code hosts** — github, gitlab
- **Package registries** — npm, PyPI, crates.io, Hex, Hackage, NuGet, Maven, RubyGems, Packagist, pub.dev, Go packages
- **Research sources** — arxiv, semantic scholar
- **Forums** — stack overflow, reddit, hn
- **Docs** — mdn, readthedocs, docs.rs

Pages convert to markdown with link structure intact. The agent can cite, follow, and quote without losing anchors.

### Security databases

Vuln lookups answer with vendor data, not blog summaries.

- **NVD** — national vulnerability database
- **OSV** — open source vuln feed
- **CISA KEV** — known exploited vulns

## Roughly **~80,000** lines of Rust, doing the work other harnesses shell out for.

Six crates, one platform-tagged N-API addon. Search, shell, AST, highlight, PTY, desktop control, image decode, BPE counting — all in-process on the libuv pool. No fork/exec on the hot path. Another ~80k lines ride along vendored: the brush bash fork, plus 58 command-line utilities — coreutils, findutils, sed, jq, ripgrep-backed grep, fd, diff, moreutils — ported into the builtins crate and compiled straight into the shell.

- Crates: `pi-natives`, `pi-shell`, `pi-ast`, `pi-iso`, `pi-voice`, `pi-walker`
- Platforms: `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `darwin-x64`, `darwin-arm64`, `win32-x64`, `win32-arm64` — x64 ships dual AVX2 and baseline binaries

## Four entry points: _interactive_, _one-shot_, RPC, and ACP.

Same engine, four wrappers. `omp` runs the TUI. `omp -p` answers a single prompt and exits. The Node SDK embeds the session in your process. `omp --mode rpc` and `omp acp` hand the wheel to another program over stdio.

### Interactive — when in doubt, the agent asks

The TUI is the default surface. Tool calls render as cards, edits preview before they land, and ambiguity routes through the `ask` tool — a structured option picker the agent can call mid-turn. The keyboard handles the rest.

The same prompt cards surface over ACP, so editors get the picker without writing one.

### SDK — embed in Node

`@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent`

Node and TypeScript hosts pull the engine in directly. The package exposes `ModelRegistry`, `SessionManager`, `createAgentSession`, and `discoverAuthStorage`; the session emits typed events you subscribe to.

```ts
import {
  ModelRegistry,
  SessionManager,
  createAgentSession,
  discoverAuthStorage,
} from "@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent";

const auth = await discoverAuthStorage();
const models = new ModelRegistry(auth);
await models.refresh();

const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  sessionManager: SessionManager.inMemory(),
  authStorage: auth,
  modelRegistry: models,
});
await session.prompt("list .ts files");
```

### RPC — drive over stdio

`omp --mode rpc`

For non-Node embedders, or when you want process isolation. NDJSON commands in, response and event frames out; each prompt ends with its own `prompt_result`. `--mode rpc-ui` adds tool cards, selectors, and dialogs as `extension_ui_request` frames the host must answer; `--no-ui` keeps even extension dialogs off the wire for hosts with no UI.

```
$ omp --mode rpc --no-session
> {"id":"r1","type":"prompt","message":"list .ts files"}
< {"id":"r1","type":"response", ...}
> {"id":"r2","type":"set_model","provider":"anthropic","modelId":"sonnet-4.5"}
> {"id":"r3","type":"abort"}
```

### ACP — speak to editors

`omp acp`

The [Agent Client Protocol](https://github.com/zed-industries/agent-client-protocol) over JSON-RPC. When the editor advertises capabilities, tool I/O routes through it and writes are gated by `session/request_permission`.

| omp tool     | ACP route                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `bash`       | `terminal/create + terminal/output` |
| `read`       | `fs/read_text_file`                 |
| `write`      | `fs/write_text_file`                |
| `edit, bash` | `session/request_permission`        |

## A harness worth keeping is one you _don't_ outgrow.

Pick it up at **[omp.sh](https://omp.sh)**.

omp is a fork of [Pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) by [Mario Zechner](https://github.com/mariozechner), rewritten as a coding-first surface: sessions, subagents, slash commands, extensions — all TypeScript, all MIT, all on [GitHub](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi). Shape it from config, hook it from outside, or read the source when you need to.

### Primitives

An extension is a TypeScript module. Same tool API, same slash-command registry, same hotkey table, same TUI primitives the built-ins use. Nothing is reserved.

### Discovery

On first run omp inherits whatever is already on disk: rules, skills, and MCP servers from `.claude`, `.cursor`, `.windsurf`, `.gemini`, `.codex`, `.cline`, `.github/copilot`, and `.vscode`. No migration script.

### Extensibility

Ask omp to write the piece you're missing, then `/reload-plugins`. Keep it local, ship it in a `marketplace`, or publish it to npm.

## Philosophy

omp is a fork of [pi-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) by [Mario Zechner](https://github.com/mariozechner), extended with a batteries-included coding workflow.

Key ideas:

- Keep interactive terminal-first UX for real coding work
- Include practical built-ins (tools, sessions, branching, subagents, extensibility)
- Make advanced behavior configurable rather than hidden

---

## Development

### Getting started from source

Fresh clones need both workspace dependencies and the local Rust/N-API addon before the source CLI can start.

```sh
bun setup
bun dev
```

`bun setup` installs Bun workspaces and builds `@oh-my-pi/pi-natives`. Re-run `bun run build:native` after changing Rust crates or `packages/natives`.

Nix users get the pinned Bun and Rust toolchains plus all native build dependencies:

```sh
nix develop
bun setup
bun dev
```

Build and smoke-test the distributable Nix package with `nix build .#omp`. Wayland screencast support is off by default (linking libpipewire adds ~750 MB of runtime closure); enable it with `omp.override { withWaylandScreencast = true; }`. `nix/bun.nix` is generated only when `bun.lock` changes; releases regenerate it automatically. For dependency changes, run:

```sh
bun run gen:nix
```

The command uses `bun2nix` from `nix develop` when available, otherwise enters the development shell through Nix, then falls back to the pinned `bunx bun2nix@2.1.2`. Do not edit `nix/bun.nix` manually.

For a non-interactive smoke check:

```sh
bun dev -- --version
```

To verify the TokenGo HTTP contract without network access, run the local Bun
relay fixture and its integration checks:

```sh
bun test scripts/token-go-smoke.test.ts
```

For a manual CLI session, start the relay in one terminal:

```sh
bun scripts/token-go-fake-relay.ts
```

Copy the printed `TOKENGO_BASE_URL`, `TOKENGO_PAT`, and `TOKENGO_API_KEY`
assignments into the environment of the CLI process.

```sh
bun packages/coding-agent/src/cli.ts login token-go --token "$TOKENGO_PAT"
bun packages/coding-agent/src/cli.ts models --json
bun packages/coding-agent/src/cli.ts -p --model token-go/claude-sonnet-4-5 "ping"
```

The fixture covers PAT dashboard authentication, model discovery, Anthropic
Messages, OpenAI Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses streaming, pricing `403`,
and model discovery from an offline JSON snapshot. It is self-contained under
[`scripts/fixtures/token-go-relay.ts`](scripts/fixtures/token-go-relay.ts), so
provider tests can reuse it before a real TokenGo account is configured.

### Debug Command

`/debug` opens tools for debugging, reporting, and profiling.
