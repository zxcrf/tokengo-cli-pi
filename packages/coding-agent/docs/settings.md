# Settings Reference

This reference lists user-configurable settings, their types, defaults, and purposes. Project settings override agent-directory settings. Resource lists are combined. See [Configuration](configuration.md) for file locations and trust behavior.

## Model and thinking

<a id="model-cycling"></a>

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `defaultProvider` | string | Automatic | Startup AI provider. |
| `defaultModel` | string | Automatic | Startup model ID. |
| `defaultThinkingLevel` | `"off" \| "minimal" \| "low" \| "medium" \| "high" \| "xhigh" \| "max"` | `"medium"` | Startup thinking level. |
| `modelThinkingLevels` | object | None | Per-model startup thinking levels keyed by exact `provider/modelId`. |
| `thinkingBudgets` | object | Built-in budgets | Token budgets for `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, and `high` thinking levels. |
| `allowedProviders` | `string[]` | `["token-go"]` | Built-in providers that are visible. `["*"]` enables every built-in provider, `[]` enables none. Providers from `models.json` and extensions are not affected. A `models.json` entry for a hidden built-in id is treated as a custom provider with only the models it lists. Global setting only. |
| `enabledModels` | `string[]` | All available models | Model patterns used for startup selection and model cycling. Uses the same format as `--models`. |
| `hideThinkingBlock` | boolean | `false` | Hide thinking blocks in the transcript. |
| `showCacheMissNotices` | boolean | `false` | Show notices for significant cache misses, successful cache warming, compaction usage, and provider recovery. |
| `cacheWarming` | `"off" \| "streaming" \| "idle"` | `"streaming"` | Keep eligible provider prompt caches warm during active runs or, with `"idle"`, between runs. Global setting only. |

Cache warming runs only when the model declares a cache lifetime and Pi estimates at least $0.05 in avoided cache-miss cost. Refresh usage counts toward session totals but does not enter model context. `/session` shows the next decision; extensions can override it with `cache_warming_decision`. See [Prompt Cache Lifetimes](models.md#prompt-cache-lifetimes).

See [Choose a Model](models.md) for model selection and thinking controls.

## Interaction

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `steeringMode` | `"all" \| "one-at-a-time"` | `"one-at-a-time"` | How queued steering messages are delivered. |
| `followUpMode` | `"all" \| "one-at-a-time"` | `"one-at-a-time"` | How queued follow-up messages are delivered. |
| `externalEditor` | string | `$VISUAL`, `$EDITOR`, then platform default | Command opened by the external-editor keybinding. |
| `doubleEscapeAction` | `"tree" \| "fork" \| "none"` | `"tree"` | Action for double Escape with an empty editor. |
| `treeFilterMode` | `"default" \| "no-tools" \| "user-only" \| "labeled-only" \| "all"` | `"default"` | Initial filter used by `/tree`. |
| `defaultProjectTrust` | `"ask" \| "always" \| "never"` | `"ask"` | Fallback project-trust behavior. **Can only be set in agent-directory settings.** |

## Tools

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `defaultTools` | `string[]` | `read`, `bash`, `edit`, `write` | Tools enabled at startup. Plain names replace the defaults; `+name` adds a tool and `-name` removes one. An empty array disables all built-in tools but not extension or SDK tools. |
| `codemode.mode` | `"on"` \| `"only"` | `"on"` | How the `codemode` tool presents tools while it is active. `on`: declared tools get a note on calling them from scripts appended to their description, and `codemode` lists only tools that are not declared. `only`: `codemode` lists every tool scripts can call, and active built-in and extension tools are hidden from the model, so it reaches them through `codemode`. |
| `codemode.inlineBudget` | number | `3000` | Estimated tokens (characters / 4) the `codemode` tool's description may spend on tool declarations. Tools that do not fit are left out and found with `searchTools()`. `0` lists only namespaces. |

Available built-in tools are `read`, `bash`, `powershell`, `edit`, `write`, `grep`, `find`, and `ls`. `defaultTools` can also name `codemode` and `tool_search`, which built-in extensions register inactive, and other extension tools registered inactive.

A list of only `+name` and `-name` entries changes the inherited selection instead of replacing it. For example, this enables `codemode` next to the default tools:

```json
{
  "defaultTools": ["+codemode"]
}
```

This replaces `bash` with `powershell` and enables `grep`: `["-bash", "+powershell", "+grep"]`. Project settings apply on top of user settings: a project list with only `+name` and `-name` entries changes the user's selection, and a project list with a plain name replaces it. In one list, plain names form the selection, and `+name` and `-name` then apply in order.

`/reload` enables tools newly added to `defaultTools`. It does not disable tools removed from it or re-enable unchanged tools you turned off. `--tools`, `--no-tools`, and `--no-builtin-tools` override `defaultTools`, also on reload.

CLI tool options override this setting for one invocation; `--tools` does not accept `+name` or `-name`. See [Command Line](cli.md#tools).

## Sessions and context

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionDir` | string | Agent session directory | Session storage directory. Relative paths resolve from the working directory. `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` and `--session-dir` override this setting. |

### Compaction

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `compaction.enabled` | boolean | `true` | Enable automatic compaction. |
| `compaction.reserveTokens` | number | `16384` | Tokens reserved for the model response. |
| `compaction.keepRecentTokens` | number | `20000` | Recent tokens retained without summarization. |
| `compaction.modelOverrides` | object | None | Per-model token settings keyed by exact `provider/modelId`. |

<a id="per-model-compaction-overrides"></a>

Compaction token values must be non-negative safe integers. Each value resolves independently from the matching model override, then the ordinary compaction setting, then the built-in default. Project and user objects merge before model lookup.

See [Compaction Reference](compaction.md) for trigger, summarization, and validation behavior.

### Branch summaries

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `branchSummary.reserveTokens` | number | `16384` | Tokens reserved when summarizing branch history. |
| `branchSummary.skipPrompt` | boolean | `false` | Skip the branch-summary prompt and default to no summary. |

## Terminal and display

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `theme` | string | `"system"` | Built-in or custom theme name. `system` derives colors from the terminal theme. |
| `quietStartup` | boolean \| `"header"` | `false` | `true` hides the startup header and loaded-resource listing. `"header"` keeps the header (version and key hints) but hides the model scope line and loaded-resource listing. |
| `tuiMode` | `"regular" \| "fullscreen"` | `"fullscreen"` | Interactive terminal UI mode. |
| `fullscreenExitOutput` | `"transcript" \| "resume-hint"` | `"transcript"` | Output printed when fullscreen mode exits. |
| `fullscreenScrollbar` | `"auto" \| "always" \| "hidden"` | `"auto"` | Fullscreen transcript scrollbar behavior. |
| `fullscreenCopyOnSelect` | boolean | `true` | Copy selected text automatically in fullscreen mode. |
| `fullscreenWheelScrollLines` | `"auto"` \| number | `"auto"` | Lines per mouse-wheel event in fullscreen mode, from 1 to 100. `"auto"` moves one line per event in local macOS terminals, which already accelerate wheel and trackpad input; elsewhere, and over SSH, it speeds up fast wheel spins to at most 6 lines per event. Alt+wheel moves five times as far. |
| `editorPaddingX` | number | `0` | Horizontal editor padding from 0 to 3 cells. |
| `outputPad` | `0 \| 1` | `1` | Horizontal transcript padding. |
| `autocompleteMaxVisible` | number | `5` | Visible autocomplete entries, from 3 to 20. |
| `showHardwareCursor` | boolean | `false` | Show the terminal cursor while Pi positions it for input methods. |
| `terminal.showImages` | boolean | `true` | Display inline images when supported. |
| `terminal.imageWidthCells` | number | `60` | Preferred inline image width in terminal cells. |
| `terminal.clearOnShrink` | boolean | `false` | Clear empty rows when rendered content shrinks. |
| `terminal.showTerminalProgress` | boolean | `false` | Show OSC 9;4 progress in the terminal tab. |
| `terminal.hyperlinks` | `boolean \| "auto"` | `"auto"` | Override OSC 8 hyperlink detection. |
| `terminal.images` | `"kitty" \| "iterm2" \| "auto" \| false` | `"auto"` | Override inline-image protocol detection. |
| `terminal.trueColor` | `boolean \| "auto"` | `"auto"` | Override true-color detection. |
| `images.autoResize` | boolean | `true` | Resize images to at most 2000 by 2000 pixels before sending them to a model. |
| `images.blockImages` | boolean | `false` | Prevent images from being sent to models. |
| `markdown.codeBlockIndent` | string | `"  "` | Prefix used to indent rendered code blocks. |
| `markdown.mermaid` | `"off" \| "final" \| "streaming"` | `"streaming"` | Mermaid rendering mode. |

See [Themes](themes.md) and [Terminal Setup](terminal-setup.md) for format and platform details.

## Network and retries

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `transport` | `"auto" \| "sse" \| "websocket" \| "websocket-cached"` | `"auto"` | Preferred transport for AI providers that support multiple transports. |
| `httpProxy` | string | None | Proxy URL applied as `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` for Pi-managed HTTP clients. **Can only be set in agent-directory settings.** |
| `httpIdleTimeoutMs` | number | `300000` | HTTP header and body idle timeout in milliseconds. Set to `0` to disable. |
| `websocketConnectTimeoutMs` | number | `15000` | WebSocket connection timeout in milliseconds. Set to `0` to disable. |
| `retry.enabled` | boolean | `true` | Enable automatic agent-level retry for transient failures. |
| `retry.maxRetries` | number | `3` | Maximum agent-level retry attempts. |
| `retry.baseDelayMs` | number | `2000` | Initial exponential-backoff delay in milliseconds. |
| `retry.maxAgentDelayMs` | number | `60000` | Maximum agent-level retry delay in milliseconds. |
| `retry.provider.timeoutMs` | number | `httpIdleTimeoutMs` | Provider request timeout in milliseconds. |
| `retry.provider.maxRetries` | number | `0` | Provider-level retry attempts. |
| `retry.provider.maxRetryDelayMs` | number | `60000` | Maximum server-requested delay in milliseconds. Set to `0` to disable the limit. |

Keep `retry.provider.maxRetries` at `0` unless provider-level retries are required. Provider retries can delay Pi from handling quota and usage-limit errors itself.

## Shell

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `shellPath` | string | Platform default | Custom shell executable path. Supports a leading `~`. |
| `shellCommandPrefix` | string | None | Prefix prepended to every shell command. |
| `npmCommand` | `string[]` | `npm` | Command and arguments used for npm package lookup and installation. |

See [Shell aliases](shell-aliases.md) for shell setup and [Pi Packages](packages.md) for package-manager behavior.

## Resources

Resource paths in user settings resolve from the agent directory. Paths in project settings resolve from the project `.pi` directory. Absolute paths and `~` are supported.

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `packages` | array | `[]` | npm, git, or local Pi package sources. See [Pi Packages](packages.md). |
| `extensions` | `string[]` | `[]` | Extension files or directories. |
| `skills` | `string[]` | `[]` | Skill files or directories. |
| `prompts` | `string[]` | `[]` | Prompt-template files or directories. |
| `themes` | `string[]` | `[]` | Theme files or directories. |
| `enableSkillCommands` | boolean | `true` | Register skills as `/skill:name` commands. |

Resource arrays support glob exclusions with `!pattern`, exact inclusion with `+path`, and exact exclusion with `-path`. Pi loads resources listed in both user-level and project settings.

The built-in extensions are named `builtin:mcp`, `builtin:llama.cpp`, `builtin:codemode`, and `builtin:tool-search` in `extensions`. They load by default; `-builtin:mcp` disables one. A `+builtin:<name>` or `-builtin:<name>` entry in project settings overrides the user setting. `pi config` lists them under Built-in. `--no-extensions` disables them too, and `-e builtin:<name>` loads one explicitly.

## Updates, telemetry, and warnings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `collapseChangelog` | boolean | `false` | Show a condensed changelog after an update. |
| `enableInstallTelemetry` | boolean | `false` | Enable anonymous install/update reporting and selected provider attribution headers. Does not control update checks. |
| `enableAnalytics` | boolean | `false` | Opt in to analytics data sharing. Currently used only by the experimental first-run setup. |
| `warnings.anthropicExtraUsage` | boolean | `true` | Warn when Anthropic subscription authentication may use paid extra usage. |
